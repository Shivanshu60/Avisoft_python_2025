Following years of speculation and anticipation, Rockstar confirmed in February 2022 that the game was in development. That September, footage from unfinished versions wasleakedonline in what journalists described as one of the biggest leaks in the history of thevideo game industry. The game was formally revealed in December 2023 and is scheduled to be released in late 2025 for thePlayStation 5andXbox Series X/S.

Grand Theft Auto VIis set in the fictionalopen worldstate of Leonida—based onFlorida—which includes Vice City, a fictionalised version ofMiami.[1][2][3]Vice City was previously featured inGrand Theft Auto(1997) and as the main setting ofGrand Theft Auto: Vice City(2002) andGrand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories(2006).[4][5][6]The game world parodies contemporaryAmerican culture, with satirical depictions ofsocial mediaandinfluencerculture, and references toInternet memessuch asFlorida Man.[7][8][9]The story follows a criminal duo: Lucia, the series's first female protagonist since 2000,[b]and her male partner;[a]the first trailer depicts Lucia as a prison inmate, and later evading custody with her partner.[2][16]

Preliminary work onGrand Theft Auto VIbegan in 2014, afterGrand Theft Auto V's release, and principal development started afterRed Dead Redemption 2's release in 2018.[17][18]During production, the game was code-namedProject Americas.[18]JournalistJason Schreierreported the game was "a moderately sized release" that would expand over time, to avoid its predecessors'developer crunch,[19]and that it would feature twoBonnie and Clyde–inspired protagonists, including aLatinawoman,[18]and "a significant online mode" akin toGrand Theft Auto Online.[17]He claimed the developers were cautiously subverting the series's trend of joking aboutmarginalised groups.[18][20]In 2018,The Knowreported that the game would be set primarily in Vice City and partly inSouth America,[21]and in 2021, Tom Henderson claimed its map could evolve akin toFortnite.[22][23]

The game became highly anticipated in the years before its announcement,[24][25][26]and journalists noted some fans became frustrated byRockstar Games's continued silence, particularly after they announced a re-release ofGrand Theft Auto Vin 2020.[27][28][29]An individual referencing the game received media attention for interrupting several live stage and television shows.[30][31][32]On 4 February 2022, Rockstar confirmed development was "well underway".[33]In July, Rockstar announcedRed Dead Onlinewould not receive more major updates as development resources were withdrawn to focus on the upcoming game;[34]industry sources stated Rockstar reallocated resources after planned remasters ofGrand Theft Auto IV(2008) andRed Dead Redemption(2010) were paused due to the backlash received byGrand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition(2021).[35]

In November 2023,Sam Houser, the president of Rockstar Games, announced the first trailer would release in early December to celebrate the company's 25th anniversary.[36][37]Within five hours, the announcement onX (formerly Twitter)surpassed two previous posts about the game to become the platform's most-likedgaming-related post,[38][39][40]later surpassed by Rockstar's post announcing the trailer's 5 December release date, with 1.8 million likes in 24 hours.[41]Other developers imitated the announcement's formatting to promote their trailers.[42][43][15]On 4 December, a low-quality version of the trailer was leaked on X; in response, Rockstar published the official version onYouTube, revealing the title, protagonists, setting, and release window of 2025 for thePlayStation 5andXbox Series X/S.[44][45][46]

The trailer broke the record for most first-day views on a non-music YouTube video within 12 hours, with 46 million,[47][48]and, within 24 hours, became the third-most-viewed overall, with 93 million,[49][50][51]and most-liked game trailer, with 8.9 million.[52][53]It surpassed the lifetime viewership ofGrand Theft Auto V's 2011 reveal trailer within two days, with 101 million views,[54]and became the second-most-viewed game trailer by January, with 168 million.[55]Its featured song,Tom Petty's "Love Is a Long Road", saw a near-37,000% increase inSpotifystreams, had almost 250,000 searches onShazam, and ranked second on the worldwideiTuneschart.[56]The trailer spawned fan-created recreations in other video games, as abrickfilm, and in live-action by theHyundai World Rally Team.[57][58][59]

In February 2024, Schreier reported that Rockstar requested employees ceaseremote workand return to offices full time from April "for productivity and security" as development entered its "final stages".[60][61][62]TheIndependent Workers' Union of Great Britaincriticised Rockstar's decision for contradicting its promise to maintain flexible working conditions; some employees were concerned it could negatively impact staff health and morale and prompt resignations and crunch conditions.[62][63]In March,Kotaku's Zack Zwiezen reported the decision was partly to avoid a delay from the internally scheduled early 2025 release window; development "falling behind" meant late 2025 seemed more practical, with a potential delay to 2026 as a "fallback plan".[64][65]Rockstar's parent companyTake-Two Interactive'sshare pricedropped by more than five per cent,[66]though other journalists refuted the report and said the game remained "on schedule".[67][68]In May, Take-Two confirmed the game was scheduled for thethirdorfourth quarterof 2025.[69]According to Schreier, other publishers are hesitant to schedule their own games to avoid potential competition withGrand Theft Auto VI.[17]It won Most Wanted Game at theGolden Joystick Awardsand Most Anticipated Game atthe Game Awardsin 2024.[70][71]

On 18 September 2022, a user known as "teapotuberhacker"[c]published 90 videos toGTAForumsshowing 50 minutes of work-in-progress game footage.[74]Schreier confirmed with sources at Rockstar that the footage was genuine,[75]andThe Guardianreported it was from several stages of development,[74]with some videos about a year old.[4]The footage revealed a modern-day Vice City setting, contained animation and gameplay tests, level layouts, and character conversations, and depicted the player characters, Lucia and Jason, entering astrip cluband robbing adiner.[4][14]The hacker claimed to be responsible for theUber security breachfrom the prior week,[75][76]said they had downloaded the files directly from Rockstar's internalSlackgroups,[77]and claimed to possesssource code, assets, and internal builds ofGrand Theft AutoVandVI, which they threatened to publish.[75]

Take-Two responded by submittingtakedownsof videos showing or discussing the leaks hosted on YouTube,[74][78]and contactedGTAForumsandRedditmoderators to remove access.[79]The hacker wrote they were "looking to negotiate a deal" with Rockstar or Take-Two.[80]Journalists described the event as one of the biggest leaks invideo game history;[81][82][83]Schreier called it "a nightmare for Rockstar Games" which could limit employees' remote work flexibility.[84][85]TheJefferies Groupanalyst Andrew Uerkwitz called it a "PR disaster" that could potentially delay the game and diminish staff morale, but was unlikely to impact reception or sales.[86][87]The Guardiannoted the leaked footage was being widely criticised "by ill-informed users" due to its quality, despite not being representative of the final product.[74]Some users erroneously claimed graphics and art assets are finalised early in game development. In solidarity, several developers shared work-in-progress footage of their games[88][89][90]and some, includingCliff Bleszinski,Neil Druckmann,Rami Ismail, andAlanah Pearce, offered sympathies to Rockstar.[4][74][91]

On 19 September, Rockstar confirmed the leak to be a "network intrusion" and lamented how the game was first demonstrated but did not anticipate long-term effects on development.[92]They disabled comments and replies on their social media accounts in the days following the leak.[73]Take-Two added that steps had been taken "to isolate and contain this incident".[86]Take-Two's share price dropped by more than six per cent inpre-market tradingthat day,[86][87]but recovered duringregular trading hoursfollowing their statement.[93]Uberacknowledged the potential links to their security breach and noted they were working with theFederal Bureau of Investigationand theUnited States Department of Justice. They believed the hacker was affiliated with the groupLapsus$, which was thought to have breached companies such asMicrosoft,Nvidia, andSamsungover the preceding year.[94][95]Take-Two'sStrauss Zelnicksaid the incident caused the companies to become more vigilant withcybersecurityand had impacted staff emotionally but business remained unaffected.[96][97]Rockstar later claimed the incident cost the companyUS$5 millionand thousands of staff hours to recover.[98]

A 17-year-old boy fromOxfordshire—identified as "teapotuberhacker" and a key member of Lapsus$—was arrested by theCity of London Policeon 22 September as part of an investigation supported by theNational Cyber Crime Unitand American federal law enforcement.[99][100][101]While onbailfor hackingEEand Nvidia and underpolice protectionat aTravelodgehotel, he breached Rockstar using a mobile phone, television, and anAmazon Fire TV Stickand threatened to release the source code in a Slack message to all Rockstar staff.[98][101][102]Appearing before the Highbury Corner Youth Court, hepleadedguilty to two counts ofbreaching bail conditionsand not guilty to two counts ofcomputer misuse.[103][104][105]The case was referred to a higher court while the boy wasremandedto ayouth detention centre.[105][106]In mid-2023, he stood trial atSouthwark Crown Courtfor twelve offences, including six counts of computer misuse, three of blackmail, and two of fraud.[101][107]He was deemedunfit to stand trialdue to hisautism;[98][102]instead of assessing his guilt, a jury determined he had committed the acts.[101][108]In December 2023, he was placed under an indefinitehospital orderby a judge for being a high public risk as he expressed an intent to continue committingcybercrimes.[98][102]

On 1 January 2025, a Reddit user posted a photograph and two videos of a PlayStation 5development kitrunning the game, taken by someone who "worked at the Rockstar office for a few months" in mid-2021; the post was later deleted. Based on the office's surroundings,Eurogamerdetermined the photo and videos were taken atRockstar San Diego.[109][110][111]Polygon's Ian Walker found no new information was revealed from the post, which he called the "worst leak of all time".[110]
