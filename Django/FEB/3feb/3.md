How to access your version of toflerweb through the browser and how to test your changes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. It is important to whitelist your IP by visiting www.tofler.in/devaccess (you need to be logged in with the appropriate ID)
2. Your copy of the webserver listens on port 83. So you can access your copy at https://13.127.239.9:83
3. After you make any changes to the backend, you need to reload apache webserver. You can do this by running: sudo ./restart-apache.sh
4. If the website throws an error, you can run sudo ./showweblog.sh and retry the webpage - to see what error is being thrown
